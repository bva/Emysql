## Emysql

Erlang mysql driver. Fork with a tad more doku and samples, some fixes.


#### History

While you can use mysql via ODBC, using emysql, or another native solution, should perform better.

There are three native solutions out there it seems  
* [erlang-mysql / Yxa](https://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/Yxa) of 2005-08 by Process One  
* [erlang-mysql-driver](http://code.google.com/p/erlang-mysql-driver/) a 2006 derivate by Yariv Sadan, Dave Smith et al  
* [emysql](http://github.com/JacobVorreuter/emysql) a 2009 rewrite by Jacob Vorreuter, Bill Warnecke  

This here is a fork of the newest one, [JacobVorreuter/emysql](http://github.com/JacobVorreuter/emysql) with a tad more docu & samples.

[Jacob Vorreuter](http://github.com/JacobVorreuter) in 2009 rewrote
[Yariv Sadan's](http://yarivsblog.com/) 2006-07 
[erlang-mysql-driver](http://code.google.com/p/erlang-mysql-driver/),
which was a derivate and extension of
[Process One's Yxa erlang-mysql](https://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/Yxa) of 2006. 
Yxa meanwhile had an extension patch in 2008 that never made it into Yariv's driver, 
which has not been updated since Oct '07. 
In Feb '10, [Dave Smith](http://github.com/dizzyd) started making some
[updates](http://github.com/dizzyd/erlang-mysql-driver) and put them on github.

Jacob rewrote the erlang-mysql-driver code because he felt it had been touched by so many
people that it had become more complicated than necessary. According to Jacob, Emysql
is pretty stable and ran without issue in an production environment at Electronic Arts.

[Vitaliy Batichko](https://github.com/bva) and [jugg](https://github.com/jugg) have contributed fixes to this branch.

Thank you!

## Hints on Usage 

#### Start the application

	crypto:start(),
	application:start(emysql).
	
#### Add a pool
emysql:add\_pool(PoolName, PoolSize, Username, Password, Host, Port, Database, Encoding) -> ok | {error, pool\_already\_exists}  
PoolName = atom()  
PoolSize = integer()  
Username = string()  
Password = string()  
Host = string()  
Port = integer()  
Database = string()  
Encoding = atom()  

	emysql:add_pool(mypoolname, 1, "username", "mypassword", "localhost", 3306, "mydatabase", utf8).
	
#### Record Types
	-record(ok_packet, {seq_num, affected_rows, insert_id, status, warning_count, msg}).
	-record(error_packet, {seq_num, code, msg}).
	-record(result_packet, {seq_num, field_list, rows, extra}).

#### Executing SQL statements
emysql:execute(PoolName, Statement) -> result\_packet() | ok\_packet() | error\_packet()  
PoolName = atom()  
Statement = string() | binary()  	

	emysql:execute(mypoolname, <<"SELECT * from mytable">>).
	#result_packet{field_list=[...], rows=[...]}
	
	emysql:execute(mypoolname, <<"UPDATE mytable SET bar = 'baz' WHERE id = 1">>).
	#ok_packet{affected_rows=1}
	
#### Executing prepared statements
emysql:prepare(StmtName, Statement) -> ok  
StmtName = atom()  
Statement = binary() | string()  

	emysql:prepare(my_stmt, <<"SELECT * from mytable WHERE id = ?">>).
	ok
	
emysql:execute(PoolName, StmtName, Args) -> result\_packet() | ok\_packet() | error\_packet()  
StmtName = atom()  
Args = [term()]  

	emysql:execute(mypoolname, my_stmt, [1]).
	#result_packet{field_list=[...], rows=[...]}

#### Converting Row Data To Records
emysql\_util:as\_record(ResultPacket, RecordName, Fields) -> Result  
ResultPacket = result\_packet()  
RecordName = atom() (the name of the record to generate)  
Fields = [atom()] (the field names to generate for each record)  
Result = [record()]  

	-module(fetch_example).
	-record(foo, {bar, baz, bat}).
	
	fetch_foo() ->
	   Result = emysql:execute(pool1, <<"select bar, baz, bat from foo">>),
	   Recs = emysql_util:as_record(Result, foo, record_info(fields, foo)),
	   [begin
		  io:format("foo: ~p, ~p, ~p~n", [Foo#foo.bar, Foo#foo.baz, Foo#foo.bat])
	    end || Foo <- Recs].

## Samples

#### Hello World
To run the following, first build emysql.app, using make, 
and be sure to have ./ebin in your Erlang path. See sample programms, below.
	
	-module(a_hello).
	-export([run/0]).

	run() ->

		crypto:start(),
		application:start(emysql),

		emysql:add_pool(hello_pool, 1,
			"hello_username", "hello_password", "localhost", 3306,
			"hello_database", utf8),

		emysql:execute(hello_pool,
			<<"INSERT INTO hello_table SET hello_text = 'Hello World!'">>),

	    Result = emysql:execute(hello_pool,
    		<<"select hello_text from hello_table">>),

		io:format("~n~p~n", [Result]).


#### Sample database
For the above sample, create a local mysql database:
	
	mysql> create database hello_database;
	mysql> use hello_database;
	mysql> create table hello_table (hello_text char(20));
	mysql> grant all privileges on hello_database.* to hello_username@localhost identified by 'hello_password';


#### Run Samples
Sample programs are in ./samples. 

* [a_hello](http:Emysql/blob/master/samples/a_hello.erl) - Hello World
* [a_hello2](http:Emysql/blob/master/samples/a_hello2.erl) - Hello World somewhat rawer
* [b_rows_as_records](http:Emysql/blob/master/samples/b_rows_as_records.erl) - Using Erlang records to access result rows
* [c_stored_procedure](http:Emysql/blob/master/samples/c_stored_procedure.erl) - Using Stored procedures

To run the samples, create the database as listed above at localhost, and:

	$ cd samples
	$ ./a_hello
	$ ./a_hello2
	$ ./b_rows_as_records
	$ ./c_stored_procedure
	
or make emysql.app and start a_hello etc. manually along these lines (but
first create the database as listed above):

	$ make
	$ cd samples
	$ erlc a_hello.erl
	$ erl -pa ../ebin -s a_hello run -s init stop -noshell


## TODO
* decrementing pool size could close sockets that are in use
* spawn individual conn\_mgr gen\_server processes for each pool
* allow row results to be returned as binary
